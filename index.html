    <p> The environment. Trees help to combat global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide, removing and storing carbon while releasing oxygen back into the air. They also reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat upwards from their leaves.Step outside your home and we guarantee you won’t be far from a tree; unless you live in the desert of course. From pine and oak, to willow and ash, we’re surrounded by a huge variety of different types of them.

The value and purpose of trees is enormous; and their existence is vital for our survival.Trees help to combat global warming by absorbing carbon dioxide, removing and storing carbon while releasing oxygen back into the air.They also reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat upwards from their leaves. It’s estimated that trees can reduce the temperature in a city by up to 7°C.Other environmental benefits include the fact they help to prevent flooding and soil erosion, by absorbing thousands of litres of stormwater.</p>
